Everything under the **extensions** folder is considered stable.
 
# Folders
- **docs**: contains info/hints on using the extensions in this repository, but also on implementing/using iTop
- **utils**: some utilities I use for debugging and development
- **web/extensions**: extensions which are actively maintained. You can drop and merge this under <iTop folder>/web .

- **wip**: work in progress. Unfinished. Also contains some concepts.


# What is iTop?
iTop is an open source product by Combodo. "iTop stands for IT Operational Portal. iTop is an Open Source web application for the day to day operations of an IT environment. At the heart of iTop is the CMDB (Configuration Management Data Base), this is originally the first part of iTop that was developed."

# Compatibility
I am developing ***unofficial*** extensions (simple tweaks, extra features) for iTop 2.5.x using PHP 7.1 and MySQL 5.7.

It's unknown if these extensions work on older versions of iTop. For most of them, only minor adjustments (downgrading data model version number) might suffice.

iTop 2.4.x-branch (no longer maintained, most of my work in this master branch should still be compatible if you replace the datamodel XML version "1.5" to "1.4" in the .xml files):

# History
I (jbostoen) started using iTop in 2015. Since then, I've been using it more every day. I also stimulated others to use it.

In the meanwhile, my colleague jdefoort ( https://github.com/jdefoort ) also became an iTop enthousiast and we often collaborate on new extensions.
